What we have's the only thing worth fighting for
And I, I won't let nothing keep us apart
Through these fallouts there is
A truth and pain but through it all
You will always have my heart
I see a change on the horizon
Reasons to be frightened
I know that we can pull through
I am here to tell you
Get up and fight
Get up and fight
I can't do this thing without you
I'm lost in this without you
Get up and fight
We've gotta get up and fight
I can't handle this without you
Can't do it without you
